# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive homelab infrastructure using Docker containers with automated deployment, persistent data management, and secure remote access. The system will include monitoring, backup, file management, and productivity services, all orchestrated through Docker Compose with proper networking, SSL termination, and data persistence strategies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a homelab administrator, I want a containerized infrastructure that can be easily deployed anywhere, so that I can recreate my entire setup on different machines without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the deployment command THEN the system SHALL create all required services using Docker Compose
2. WHEN I deploy on a new machine THEN the system SHALL automatically pull all required container images and start services
3. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL create all necessary directories and configuration files automatically
4. IF a service fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and continue with other services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a homelab administrator, I want persistent data storage with GitHub integration, so that my configurations and data are backed up and can be restored on any deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make configuration changes in any service THEN the system SHALL persist changes to mapped volumes
2. WHEN I commit changes THEN the system SHALL allow pushing configuration files to GitHub repository
3. WHEN I deploy on a new system THEN the system SHALL restore data from GitHub repository
4. WHEN services restart THEN the system SHALL maintain all user data and configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a homelab administrator, I want secure external access through locally managed Cloudflare tunnels, so that all services are accessible remotely without exposing ports, managing SSL certificates, or requiring a reverse proxy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN locally managed Cloudflare tunnel SHALL automatically provide secure HTTPS access to all services
2. WHEN I access a service URL THEN the system SHALL route traffic directly through Cloudflare's secure tunnel to the service
3. WHEN I configure a new service THEN the tunnel configuration SHALL be updated to route traffic directly to the service container
4. WHEN tunnel configuration changes THEN the system SHALL automatically reload routing without requiring SSL management or reverse proxy configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a homelab administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are running THEN Prometheus SHALL collect metrics from all monitored services
2. WHEN I access Grafana THEN the system SHALL display pre-configured dashboards for system metrics
3. WHEN applications generate logs THEN Promtail SHALL collect and forward them to Loki
4. WHEN I query logs THEN Loki SHALL provide searchable log aggregation across all services

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a homelab administrator, I want a centralized dashboard, so that I can access all services from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN Dashy SHALL display all configured services with their status
2. WHEN I click a service link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct service URL
3. WHEN services are down THEN the dashboard SHALL indicate their unavailable status
4. WHEN I modify dashboard configuration THEN changes SHALL persist across container restarts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a homelab administrator, I want automated backup solutions, so that my data is protected against loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backup schedules trigger THEN Duplicati SHALL backup specified directories automatically
2. WHEN backups complete THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity
3. WHEN I need to restore data THEN Duplicati SHALL provide easy restoration interface
4. WHEN backup storage is full THEN the system SHALL rotate old backups according to retention policy

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a homelab administrator, I want file management and sharing capabilities, so that I can access and share files across my network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access FileBrowser THEN the system SHALL provide web-based file management interface
2. WHEN I upload files THEN the system SHALL store them in persistent volumes
3. WHEN I share files THEN the system SHALL generate secure sharing links
4. WHEN I manage files THEN the system SHALL maintain proper permissions and access controls

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a homelab administrator, I want productivity applications, so that I can manage personal tasks and bookmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access Linkding THEN the system SHALL provide bookmark management interface
2. WHEN I save bookmarks THEN the system SHALL persist them with tags and descriptions
3. WHEN I access Actual Budget THEN the system SHALL provide personal finance management
4. WHEN I enter financial data THEN the system SHALL store it securely with backup integration

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a homelab administrator, I want container management capabilities, so that I can monitor and control all services from a web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access Portainer THEN the system SHALL display all running containers and their status
2. WHEN I need to restart a service THEN Portainer SHALL provide container control capabilities
3. WHEN I view container logs THEN Portainer SHALL display real-time log output
4. WHEN I monitor resources THEN Portainer SHALL show CPU, memory, and network usage for containers
