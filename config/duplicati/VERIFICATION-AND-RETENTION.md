### Retention Configuration

The retention policies are defined in `retention-policies.json`:

```json
{
  "retention-policies": {
    "critical-data-daily": {
      "retention-rules": {
        "keep-daily": { "period": "1W", "interval": "1D" },
        "keep-weekly": { "period": "4W", "interval": "1W" },
        "keep-monthly": { "period": "12M", "interval": "1M" }
      },
      "cleanup-settings": {
        "auto-cleanup": true,
        "verify-before-delete": true,
        "keep-minimum-versions": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Automated Cleanup

#### Cleanup Schedule
- **Daily Backups**: Cleaned up daily at 4:00 AM
- **Weekly Backups**: Cleaned up monthly
- **System Maintenance**: Full cleanup quarterly

#### Cleanup Process
1. **Identify Expired Files**: Based on retention rules
2. **Verification Check**: Verify newer backups before deletion
3. **Minimum Version Check**: Ensure minimum versions retained
4. **Safe Deletion**: Remove expired files with logging
5. **Cleanup Verification**: Verify cleanup completed successfully
